### POST /core/latest/token

Generate tokens to access other KLARA core endpoints

A grant_type of password is used for a Password grant, which requires username, password, tenant and company id to produce access token, refresh token from scratch. A grant_type of refresh_token is used for a Refresh token grant, which is used for acquiring the access token using refresh token.
